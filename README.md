# Taylor Baker - Web Portfolio README

## üé® Design & Development Process

1. **Wireframing & Prototyping**
   - Began with **lo-fi wireframes**, followed by **hi-fi wireframes** and finally an **interactive prototype** outlining the visual layout and user flow.
   - [View my prototype design on Figma ¬ª](https://www.figma.com/design/VYsqnS8oKox6S7GsLnmbBm/baker_taylor_prototype?node-id=2553-56&t=s72VsDHvB7IHC0h0-1)

2. **Asset Preparation**
   - Exported, optimized, and organized all media, images, and SVG assets before development began.

3. **HTML Structure**
   - Created basic structure for all three pages with semantic section elements.
   - Built consistent **header and footer** across all pages.

4. **Navigation & Styling**
   - First navigation was custom coded (not using Bootstrap), but discarded due to performance issues.
   - Later iterations incorporated **Bootstrap SCSS customization**, with personalized colors, fonts, and buttons.

5. **Main Content**
   - Started with homepage content before moving to about and contact pages.
   - Alternated work sessions between different pages to avoid burnout and maintain perspective.

6. **Decorative SVG Challenge**
   - Spent 6+ hours troubleshooting positioning issues with layered SVGs.
   - Postponed finalizing home page and worked on remaining pages.

7. **Project Restart**
   - Removed ~90% of custom CSS to better integrate Bootstrap functionality.
   - Reworked layout/styling with Bootstrap classes where feasible.

8. **Final Touches**
   - Implemented custom navigation toggles for small screen sizes.
   - Applied **ARIA roles** and **schema markup** for accessibility and SEO.
   - Created responsive font sizing with CSS media queries and `clamp()`.
   - Rebuilt decorative banners and revised layered design elements.
   - Validated code and aligned project to **WCAG accessibility standards** and **color contrast guidelines**.

## üß© Challenges & Solutions

### 1. Layered SVG Positioning
- **Issue:** Decorative SVGs and overlapping images broke responsiveness and layout when resized.
- **Solution:** Spent hours testing multiple solutions, then restarted and removed these elements for a cleaner, more functional layout.
- **What I Learned:** Future implementations may require JavaScript or more advanced styling knowledge.

---

### 2. Bootstrap Font & Grid System Failures
- **Issue:** Bootstrap‚Äôs responsive classes for fonts and containers didn‚Äôt work.
- **Solution:** Applied custom CSS with `media queries` and `clamp()` sizing instead.
- **What I Learned:** Although cause is unknown, I learned to trust custom styling and problem-solve through research and instructor collaboration.

---

### 3. File Path Corruption Due to iCloud
- **Issue:** Ran out of disk space, leading to automatic migration of files to iCloud, which disrupted file paths.
- **Solution:** Relocated files and restored correct structure using GitHub Pages backup.
- **What I Learned:** Always back up work early, commit often, and keep a tidy, local file structure.

---

### 4. Social Media Icons
- **Issue:** None of Bootstrap‚Äôs built-in icon sets matched my visual style.
- **Solution:** Used custom SVG image files for social icons, which allowed for better responsiveness and control.
- **What I Learned:** SVGs are tricky, but using `<img>` tags instead of `<svg>` elements improved layout control.

## üí° What I Learned

- **Design realistically for your skill level** ‚Äì Don‚Äôt waste time implementing features beyond your knowledge base.
- **Adapt designs while staying aligned to standards** ‚Äì Especially for accessibility and responsiveness.
- **Research competitor websites** ‚Äì Many advanced features require JavaScript or PHP, which I now understand are future learning goals.
- **Start early, work consistently** ‚Äì Even with regular work sessions, some sessions stretched up to 10 hours.
- **Lean on instructor feedback** ‚Äì Transparent communication helped validate necessary design changes.
